## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-23

### Added

#### Core Features

- Initial release with TypeScript vs JavaScript file analysis
- CLI tool with `ts-file-coverage` command
- Support for .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, and .vue files
- TypeScript detection in JavaScript files
- Line counting and percentage calculations
- Comprehensive test suite (92 tests)
- ESLint and Prettier configuration

#### Enhanced Reporting

- **Framework-Specific Analysis**: Separate sections for Vue.js and React files
- **Plain JS/TS Section**: Dedicated analysis for vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript files
- **Color-Coded Coverage Indicators**: Visual coverage percentages with emoji indicators
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green (â‰¥80%): Excellent TypeScript adoption
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (60-79%): Good TypeScript adoption
  - ðŸŸ£ Magenta (40-59%): Moderate TypeScript adoption
  - ðŸ”´ Red (<40%): Low TypeScript adoption
- **Dual Coverage Metrics**: Separate file and line coverage percentages for each section
- **Percentage from Total**: Shows what portion of entire codebase each section represents

#### Smart Framework Detection

- **Vue.js Detection**: Identifies `.vue` files and TypeScript usage via `<script lang="ts">`
- **React Detection**: Identifies `.jsx`, `.tsx` files and React component patterns
- **Plain File Classification**: Separates vanilla JS/TS files from framework files
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows framework sections when files are present

#### Developer Experience

- **Colored Terminal Output**: Enhanced readability with chalk-based coloring
- **Detailed Statistics**: File counts, line counts, and multiple percentage breakdowns
- **Professional Output**: Clean, organized reporting with clear sections
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both file-level and line-level TypeScript adoption metrics

### Technical Improvements

#### Architecture

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Separate services for analysis, formatting, and summary generation
- **Framework Stats**: Unified `FrameworkStats` interface for consistent reporting
- **Smart Detection**: Advanced TypeScript syntax detection in JavaScript files

#### Code Quality

- **ESLint Integration**: Modern flat config with TypeScript-specific rules
- **Prettier Formatting**: Consistent code style across the project
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 92 passing tests covering all functionality
- **NPM Ready**: Complete package configuration for npm publication

#### Performance

- **Efficient Analysis**: Fast file discovery and content analysis
- **Optimized Reporting**: Conditional rendering of sections based on content
- **Smart Caching**: Efficient file processing and statistics generation

### Features

#### Analysis Capabilities

- Analyze TypeScript adoption in codebases of any size
- Count files and lines of code with detailed breakdowns
- Detect TypeScript syntax in JavaScript files (interfaces, types, generics, etc.)
- Support for Vue.js single file components with TypeScript detection
- React component analysis with TypeScript usage tracking
- Separate plain JavaScript/TypeScript file analysis

#### Reporting Features

- Command-line interface with directory selection
- Color-coded coverage percentages for quick assessment
- Framework-specific breakdown (Vue vs React vs Plain JS/TS)
- Dual metrics: file coverage and line coverage percentages
- Percentage of total codebase for each section
- Professional, easy-to-read terminal output

#### Use Cases

- **Migration Planning**: Assess current TypeScript adoption state
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor TypeScript migration over time
- **Team Reporting**: Generate statistics for stakeholders
- **CI/CD Integration**: Track TypeScript coverage in automated pipelines
- **Codebase Analysis**: Understand composition of large projects
